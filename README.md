## Description:
What's this is a mobile application with the purpose of helping people with disabilities such as Vision loss, blindness. We used the Clarified API, along with three more third-party libraries. By taking a picture, the Clarified API analyzes the picture, processes, and with the help of object recognition done by the AI, it gives a list of the possible items located in the picture taken. We are planning to improve our app by implementing a food nutrition database that would contain the approximate calories if the user takes a picture of an editable.
